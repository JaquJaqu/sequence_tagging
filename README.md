# Named Entity Recognition with Tensorflow



This repository contains a NER implementation using Tensorflow (based on BiLSTM + CRF and character embeddings) that is based on the implementation by [Guillaume Genthial](https://github.com/guillaumegenthial/sequence_tagging). We have modified this implementation including its documentation. The major changes are listed below:


Mainly, we have done the following changes:
- convert from python 2 to python 3
- extract parameters from source code to a single config file
- create new script for testing new files
- create new script and modify source code for simple transfer learning
- support for several embeddings (GloVe, fasttext, word2vec)
- support to load all embeddings of a model
- support to dynamically load OOV embeddings during testing

Currently, we only provide models for contemporary German and historic German texts.

## Task of Named Entity Recognition

The task of Named Entity Recognition (NER) is to predict the type of entity. Classical NER targets on the identification of locations (LOC), persons (PER), organization (ORG) and other (OTH). Here is an example

```
John   lives in New   York
B-PER  O     O  B-LOC I-LOC
```


## Machine Learning Model

The model is similar to [Lample et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01360) and [Ma and Hovy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01354.pdf). A more detailed description can be found [here](https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/sequence-tagging-with-tensorflow.html).

- concatenate final states of a bi-lstm on character embeddings to get a character-based representation of each word
- concatenate this representation to a standard word vector representation (GloVe, Word2Vec, FastText here)
- run a bi-lstm on each sentence to extract contextual representation of each word
- decode with a linear chain CRF


## Run an Existing Model

To run pre-computed models, you need to install the [required python packages](#requirements) and you need to download the model and the embeddings. This can be done automatically with a python script as described [here](#automatic-download). However, the models and the embeddings can also be downloaded manually as described [here](#manual-download).


Here, we will fully describe, how to apply the best performing GermEval model to a new file.
First, we need to download the project, the model and the embeddings:

```
git clone git@github.com:riedlma/sequence_tagging.git
cd sequence_tagging
python3 download_model_embeddings.py GermEval
```

Now, you can create a new file (called test.conll) that should be in CoNLL format and might contain the following content:

```
Diese 
Beispiel
wurde
von
Martin
Riedl
in
Stuttgart 
erstellt
.
``` 

To start the entity tagging, you run the following command:

```
python3 test.py model_transfer_learning_conll2003_germeval_emb_wiki/config test.conll 
```

The output should be as following:

```
Diese diese KNOWN Diese O
Beispiel beispiel KNOWN Beispiel O
wurde wurde KNOWN wurde O
von von KNOWN von O
Martin martin KNOWN Martin B-PER
Riedl riedl KNOWN Riedl I-PER
in in KNOWN in O
Stuttgart stuttgart KNOWN Stuttgart B-LOC
erstellt erstellt KNOWN erstellt O
. . KNOWN . O
```



## Download Models and Embeddings
We provide the best performing model for the following datasets:

All provided models are trained using transfer learning techniques. The models and the embeddings can be downloaded [manually](#manual-download) or [automatically](#automatic-download).


### Manual Download

The models can be downloaded as described in the table. The models should be stored directly on the project directory. Furthermore, they need to be uncompressed (tar xfvz \*tar.gz)

The embeddings should best be stored in the folder *embeddings* inside the project folder.
We provide the full embeddings (named Complete) and the filtered embeddings, which only contain the vocabulary of the data of the task. These filtered models have also been used to train the pre-computed models.

## Train a New Model

We will describe how a new model can be trained and show examples based on the GermEval 2014 dataset. In order to build the model, we first need to download the training data. In addition, we filter comments and only leave the word and the tags.

```
mkdir -p corpora/GermEval
wget -O corpora/GermEval/NER-de-train.tsv  https://sites.google.com/site/germeval2014ner/data/NER-de-train.tsv
wget -O corpora/GermEval/NER-de-dev.tsv  https://sites.google.com/site/germeval2014ner/data/NER-de-dev.tsv
wget -O corpora/GermEval/NER-de-test.tsv  https://sites.google.com/site/germeval2014ner/data/NER-de-test.tsv
cat corpora/GermEval/NER-de-train.tsv  | grep -v "^[#]" | cut -f2,3 > corpora/GermEval/NER-de-train.tsv.conv
cat corpora/GermEval/NER-de-test.tsv  | grep -v "^[#]" | cut -f2,3 > corpora/GermEval/NER-de-test.tsv.conv
cat corpora/GermEval/NER-de-dev.tsv  | grep -v "^[#]" | cut -f2,3 > corpora/GermEval/NER-de-dev.tsv.conv
```

In addition, you need to download the embeddings:

```
python3 download_model_embeddings.py all_models
```


Next, the configuration has to be specified. First, we create a directory where the model will be stored:

```
mkdir model_germeval
```

Then, we need to create and adjust a configuration file. For this, we can use the configuration template ( [config.template](https://github.com/riedlma/sequence_tagging/blob/master/config.template)) and copy it to the model folder:

``` 
cp config.template model_germeval
```

Additionally, all parameters that have as value *TODO* need to be adjusted. Using the current setting, we adjust following parameters:

```
[PATH]
#path where the model will be written to
dir_model_output = model_germeval

...
filename_train = corpora/GermEval/NER-de-train.tsv.conv 
filename_dev =   corpora/GermEval/NER-de-dev.tsv.conv 
filename_test =  corpora/GermEval/NER-de-test.tsv.conv 
... 

[EMBEDDINGS]
...
# path to the embeddings that are used
filename_embeddings = TODO
# path where the embeddings defined by train/dev/test are written to
filename_embeddings_trimmed = TODO
...

```

Before we train the model, we build a matrix of the embeddings that are contained in the train/dev/test in addition to the vocabulary, with the *build_vocab.py* script:

```
python3 build_vocab.py model_germeval/config
```

If you want to apply the model to other vocabulary then the one specified in train/dev/test, the model will not have any word representation and will mainly rely on the character word embedding. To prevent this, the easiest way is to add them to either the test or dev set file.

After that step, the new model can be trained, using the following command: 

```
python3 train.py model_germeval/config
```

The model can be applied to e.g. the test file as follows:

```
python3 test.py model_germeval/config corpora/GermEval/NER-de-test.tsv.conv
```



## Transfer Learning to another dataset


## Test a Model

To test a model, the *test.py* script is used and expects, the configuration file of the model and the test file

``` 
python3 test.py model_configuration test_set
```

## Requirements


To run the sourcecode you need to install the requirements from the [file](https://github.com/riedlma/sequence_tagging/blob/master/requirements.txt).
In addition, you need to build fastText manually, as described [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/tree/master/python).

## Getting started


1. Download the GloVe vectors with

```
make glove
```

Alternatively, you can download them manually [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and update the `glove_filename` entry in `config.py`. You can also choose not to load pretrained word vectors by changing the entry `use_pretrained` to `False` in `model/config.py`.

2. Build the training data, train and evaluate the model with
```
make run
```


## Details


Here is the breakdown of the commands executed in `make run`:

1. [DO NOT MISS THIS STEP] Build vocab from the data and extract trimmed glove vectors according to the config in `model/config.py`.

```
python build_data.py
```

2. Train the model with

```
python train.py
```


3. Evaluate and interact with the model with
```
python evaluate.py
```


Data iterators and utils are in `model/data_utils.py` and the model with training/test procedures is in `model/ner_model.py`

Training time on NVidia Tesla K80 is 110 seconds per epoch on CoNLL train set using characters embeddings and CRF.



## Training Data


The training data must be in the following format (identical to the CoNLL2003 dataset).

A default test file is provided to help you getting started.


```
John B-PER
lives O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
. O

This O
is O
another O
sentence
```


Once you have produced your data files, change the parameters in `config.py` like

```
# dataset
dev_filename = "data/coNLL/eng/eng.testa.iob"
test_filename = "data/coNLL/eng/eng.testb.iob"
train_filename = "data/coNLL/eng/eng.train.iob"
```
